  <h1>So mais Arretado que Voce</h1>
  <p>oi mundo, esta um belo dia la fora, passaros cantando, flores desabrochando, It's a beautiful day outside
  Birds are singing, flowers are blooming
  On days like these, kids like you
  Should be burning in hell</p>
  
  <p>Turn around, kid, It'd be a crime
  If I were to go back on the promise that I made for you
  So don't step over that line
  Or else, friend, you're gonna have a bad time</p>
  
  <p>But kids like you don't play by the rules
  And guys like me, it ain't easy to be played for fools
  So let's go, let the room get chiller
  Let's go, dirty brother killer</p>
  
  <p>Go ahead and try to hit me if you're able
  Guess you've figured now that mercy's off the table
  I can tell you're getting really sick of trying
  But I think you're just mad you keep dying</p>
  
  <p>You're not gonna win, we'll be here together
  Fighting in this judgment hall forever
  I know you just reset each time I beat ya'
  But I'll always be right back here to meet ya'</p>
  
  <p>I know you're made of gore, gore
  Love
  Love
  Love</p>
  
  <p>This is where it stops
  This is where it ends
  If you want to get past me, well you better try again
  But no matter how I stall you
  You don't give up your attack
  Do you just like the feeling
  Of your sins crawling on your back?</p>
  
 <p>Go ahead and try to hit me if you're able
  You should know by now that mercy's off the table
  Think that you can try to spare me like I'm some pawn?
  Well, you didn't spare my brother, so get dunked on!</p>
  
  <p>I know you made my friends all disappear
  But everything they cared about is why I'm here
  I am their mercy
  I am their vengeance
  I am determination</p>

  <p>I know you're made of
  Love
  Love</p>
  <p>But I think I'm stronger than you</p>
